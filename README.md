# Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to create a conversational chatbot using Langchain. It provides appropriate information given queries based on the userâ€™s provided multiple PDF files.

OpenAI model is used for the word embedding and language model. If you want, you can feel free to use other models, such as Hugging Face. We utilised FAISS for our vector DB.

The webpage is generated by Streamlit.

## Files

1. `requirements.txt`: Use this file to install all necessary dependencies for the project.
2. `cssTemplates.py`: This file contains CSS styles that are applied to the webpage, enhancing its visual appeal.
3. `get_dataset.py`: This file includes two key methods:
    1. `make_chunks`: Reads multiple PDF files provided by the user and divides texts in the files into smaller, manageable chunks.
    2. `get_vector_store`: Returns a FAISS database created using OpenAI word embeddings and text chunks generated by the `make_chunks` method.
4. `main.py`: The main script where we initiate Streamlit and display the chatbot interface. It contains two additional methods:
    1. `get_conversational_chain`: Constructs a conversational chain for the chatbot using the vector store.
    2. `handle_inputs`: Manages the chat history and displays messages from both the user and the chatbot on the webpage.
